The night inspired me and I find out exactly what I want to illustrate in my Image. Since I start to work on the project
I was juggling with couple of ideas like

- Generate sound and and image base on number of tweet for a specific region
- Produce an image base  on the use of hashtag like #democracy for the first day of spring for a specific country
- Produce an image base  on the use of hashtag like #democraty. The image will be split  in tree part. Each part 
  reprenting a country. I had in mind Ukraine, Syria and Canada.
  
Finaly I decide what kind on data I will use. I decide to use data concerning gun control. It's a subject really
important for me and I think the draw will show a lot of meaning with the data I will collect.

I have done some research to find a service to fetch the data via REST or something like that but I found nothing that satisfied me.
Only PDF, Excel or Word document. So, for the draw I will use data but retrieve manually insted via a service.

My source will be: 
http://www.gunpolicy.org/
